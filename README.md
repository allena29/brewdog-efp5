# brewdog-efp5

[Brewdog](http://www.brewdog.com) brew some pretty good beer, and folk that invest not only get an investment with some perks.... 

The investment... 
- may give a huge pay off, or be a complete disaster). 
- I've worked for a company where things were so bad the share price went down to 70p - bought a load of shares and couldn't sell them until the share price was over Â£3.00 - that was a win.... although at the time it wasn't too hard to imagine the shareprice dropping to 35p!
- If you invest in Brewdog, you get some beer based rewards (although you don't get Dividends). 

**As will all things financial - figure it out for yourself.**
