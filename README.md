(Brewdog)[http://www.brewdog.com] brew some pretty good beer, and folk that invest not only get an investment (which may give a huge pay off, or be a complete disaster). I've worked for a company where things were so bad the share price went down to 70p - bought a load of shares and couldn't sell them until the share price was over Â£3.00.

But if you invest in Brewdog, you get some beer based rewards (although you don't get Dividends). 

As will all things financial - figure it out for yourself.
